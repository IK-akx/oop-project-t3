INTRODUCTION
In our project, we have written code that allows managing online orders and the
system program. Our project provides customers with a convenient and user
friendly interface for placing and managing orders, as well as the ability to
contact technical support directly. Additionally, it enables admins to have full
control over the system's operation. This helps optimize the store's workflow.

PROJECT GOALS:
- Make the ordering process convenient for customers
- Provide admins with full control over the data in the system and the ability to
modify it
- Automate the store's operations through complete data management
